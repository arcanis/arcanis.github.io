My latest works there have been to setup a working functional test environment, rewriting a third of the application using React, and similar stuff.</p>

It's a kind of facemash but with Magic cards instead, and offering some competitive features. We plan to improve the concept and launch it on other card games in a short future.</p>

              <p>Castel is pretty fun project unrelated to the web development. It's both a library (libcastel), a compiler (castelc), and a programming language (castel itself). It is made in C++, using LLVM / Boost / CMake. I sometimes try to compile it using Emscripten.</p>
