              <p>For the past 4 years or so I've been lead maintainer for Yarn, the beloved JavaScript package manager. It led me to simultaneously wear many hats: outreach, design, support, team lead, and many more. I'm very proud of the work our team is making there üòä</p>

              <p>After a few years in London the Brexit ambiance started to weigh on me, so I decided to go back to Paris and help building the fresh JavaScript Platform team at Datadog. We are tasked with managing the tools and workflows that our frontend engineers use everyday!</p>

Let‚Äôs discuss what we have in store for the future, and what it means for our ecosystem!"</p>

              <p>About four years after my internship, Wisembly offered me a really nice full-time position in their team as frontend engineer. My work there was to setup a new test environment, to rewrite a third of the application using React, and similar stuff.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>Start9 was a multi-system console emulator, which could be used without any installation (the emulators themselves were written in JavaScript). It supported saves, filters, smartphone-as-a-controller... quite a lot, really. I wanted to monetize it somehow, but it didn't work out and I moved on. Funny story, I even applied to YCombinator with it! But I didn't get invited üòÑ</p>

              <p>Neucoin was a (now defunct) cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin. It intended to spread the adoption of crypto-coins to the masses by dedicating vast resources toward a strong marketing plan. I've worked with them as software developer for just about a year, tweaking and improving their official client.</p>

Very fun to do, I definitely advise you to jump in and try for yourself (even if it might get stressing the first few times :)</p>

              <p>Sketchfab is the leader of the 3D content publishing on the web. Using advanced technologies such as WebGL, they give artists a convenient way to showcase their works. I've worked with them as their first fulltime frontend developer, for about a year and a half.</p>

              <p>A long-running project of mine has been to implement a voxel world using WebGL. Voxplode is the conclusion of those experiments. It features a marching cube implemention, powered by a thread pool (using javascript's Workers).</p>

              <p>Castel was a pretty fun project unrelated to the web development. It was both a library (libcastel), a compiler (castelc), and a JavaScript-like programming language (castel itself), all made in C++ using LLVM / Boost / CMake.</p>
