          Development afficionado. I love experimenting and hacking with Javascript, but a bit of C++ from time to time feels refreshing.

              </h3>
              <p>Demo project, the Pokélib is the first library using the Virt.js environment. It exposes a convenient javascript API to manipulate the runtime values of a running Pokemon rom.</p>

              <p>Virt.js is an emulation environment at its core, containing useful and reusable tools. However, it also contains various emulator engine, the first one being the GameBoy. Each one being packaged as a library, they can be used in any application type.</p>

              <p>A long-running project of mine has been to implement a voxel world using WebGL. Voxplode is the conclusion of those experiments. It features a marching cube implemention, powered by a thread pool (using javascript's Workers).</p>

              </h3>
              <p>I spent a year in Canada (Montréal) for my studies. A great country, with great people! On top of meeting caribous, I also gave a few talks at <a href="http://js-montreal.org">JSMontréal</a>.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>Castel is pretty fun project unrelated to the web development. It's both a library (libcastel), a compiler (castelc), and a programming language (castel itself). It is made in C++, using LLVM / Boost / CMake. I sometimes try to compile it using Emscripten.</p>

              <p>Wisembly is a web solution whose goal is to give tools allowing a better communication between meeting participants. I stayed at this company for six month as frontend intern.</p>
