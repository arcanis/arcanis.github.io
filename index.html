              <p>And after working for startups for so long, megacorps, here I come! I joined Facebook in February 2017, focusing my efforts on improving the state of our Javascript tools. In this context, I act as core maintainer for <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn">Yarn</a>, the Javascript package manager.</p>

              <p>About four years after my internship, Wisembly offered me a really nice full-time position in their team as frontend engineer. My work there has been to setup a new test environment, to rewrite a third of the application using React, and similar stuff.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>Start9 is a pet project of mine. It's a multi-system console emulator, which can be used without any installation. Some additional features: saves, filters, smartphone-as-a-controller... quite a lot, really. I originally planned to monetize it somehow, but it didn't work out (I even applied to YCombinator with it!).</p>

              <p>I worked with a very good friend on a small app intended for every <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering'>Magic: The Gathering</a> players. It's a kind of facemash but with Magic cards instead, and offering some competitive features.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>Neucoin was a (now defunct) cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin. It intended to spread the adoption of crypto-coins to the masses by dedicating vast resources toward a strong marketing plan. I've worked with them as software developer for just about a year, tweaking and improving their official client.</p>

              <p>I regularly showcase my projects during the <a href='http://parisjs.org'>Paris.js</a> meetups. Some of them have even been <a href='http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2kkf2b'>filmed</a> (<a href='http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2kkf6n'>second part</a>)! Very fun to do, I definitely advise you to jump in and try for yourself (even if it might get stressing the first few times :)</p>

              <p>Sketchfab is the leader of the 3D content publishing on the web. Using advanced technologies such as WebGL, they give artists a convenient way to showcase their works. I've worked with them as their first fulltime frontend developer, for about a year and a half.</p>

              <p>A long-running project of mine has been to implement a voxel world using WebGL. Voxplode is the conclusion of those experiments. It features a marching cube implemention, powered by a thread pool (using javascript's Workers).</p>

              <p>I spent a year in Canada (Montréal) for my studies. A great country, with great people! On top of meeting caribous and drinking mapple syrup, I also gave a few talks at <a href="http://js-montreal.org">JSMontréal</a>.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>Castel is pretty fun project unrelated to the web development. It's both a library (libcastel), a compiler (castelc), and a programming language (castel itself). It is made in C++, using LLVM / Boost / CMake. I sometimes try to compile it using Emscripten.</p>
